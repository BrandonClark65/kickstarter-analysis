* I recommend keeping your funding goal for your play around $5000, and launching your campaign in May or June, as these are the months that produced the most successful campaigns
* Additionally, in the future for your musical in Great Britain, I recommend keeping your goal below $2000. Your original goal of $4000 is likely to fail based on kickstarters in the past, where a very small amount of campains needing over $4000 were successful.
